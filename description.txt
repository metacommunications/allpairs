What is it:

  Test combinations generator allows to create set of tests using 'pairwise combinations' method, 
  which reduces a number of combinations of variables into a lesser set which cobers most situations.

Other Tools:

What's good:

  * Free and Open-Source.
  
  * Produces good enough dataset.

  * Good set of useful features:
    
    * Developer-friendly, Iterator style for use in your scripts. 
  
    * Allows to filter out "invalid" combinations during search for the next combination.
    
    * Allows to exclude "previously tested" pairs/combinations.
    
    * Goes beyond pairs! If/when required can generate n-wise combinations.

What's not perfect:

  * Not optimal - there are tools that can create smaller set covering all the pairs. 
    However they are missing some other important features. 
  
  * Lousy written filtering function may lead to full permutation of parameters.
  
  * v.2 has become slower (as result of possibility to produce n-wise combinations)
  
  * No warranty ;)

  
History:

  * v.1 was developed at May, 2002 and was widely used in MetaCommunications Inc. 
    for multiple testing projects.

  * v.2 was developed at September, 2007 and published at the end of the year 2007.
